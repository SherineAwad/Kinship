Kinship and Relatedness 
=======================================================================================

Various ways to check kinship, relatedness, IBS, and IBS. 

Change the config.yaml file appropriately according to your data. 
Update samples.tsv to include your samples. You can edit config file to change this name.  


Then run: snakemake -jnumber_of_cores, for example for 5 cores use:

    snakemake -j5 

and for a dry run use: 

    snakemake -j1 -n 


and to print the commands in a dry run use:

    snakemake -j1 -n -p 

For the sake reproducibility, use conda to pull same versions of tools. Snakemake and conda have to be installed in your system:

    snakemake --cores --use-conda

### TODO 

Add more tools as we go
