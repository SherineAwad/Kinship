A snakefile pipeline for a quick test of relatedness and Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)
=======================================================================================


Change the config.yaml file appropriately according to your data. 
Update samples.tsv to include your samples. You can edit config file to change this name.  


Then run: snakemake -jnumber_of_cores, for example for 5 cores use:

    snakemake -j5 

and for a dry run use: 

    snakemake -j1 -n 


and to print the commands in a dry run use:

    snakemake -j1 -n -p 

For the sake reproducibility, use conda to pull same versions of tools. Snakemake and conda have to be installed in your system:

    snakemake --cores --use-conda
